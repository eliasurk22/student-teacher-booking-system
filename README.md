# student-teacher-booking-system
Hello There, This is a project I worked on during my summer internship, a student-teacher booking system!
Functionalities:
Admin - Approve student/teacher registrations 
        update/delete teacher details

Student - Login/Register
          Book Appointments with teachers
          Send Messages to Teachers
          Search teachers by name

Teacher - Login/Register
          Approve/Deny appointments
          Read Messages

the languages used were HTML, CSS, and Vue.Js

Instructions to use:
1) Download all the assets and files to one directory, with the font folder being in the same directory as the rest of the programs (to ensure the layout looks as intended)
2) Open the app by double clicking 'index.html' and explore the functions!
